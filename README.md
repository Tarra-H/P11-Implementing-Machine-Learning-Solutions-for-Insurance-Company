# Solving-Sure-Tomorrow-Insurance-Company-s-Problems

Project Description:

The insurance company Sure Tomorrow wants to solve several issues with the help of machine learning. You are also asked to evaluate the feasibility of these tasks.

Task 1: Find clients similar to specific client criteria. This task will streamline the company's marketing efforts.
Task 2: Predict whether new clients are likely to make insurance claims. Is the model's prediction better than the dummy model's prediction?
Task 3: Predict the amount of insurance claim a new client might receive using a linear regression model.
Task 4: Protect clients' personal data without compromising the model from previous tasks. It is crucial to develop data transformation algorithms that can prevent misuse of clients' personal information if it falls into the wrong hands. This is called data masking or data obfuscation. However, data protection procedures also need to ensure that the quality of the machine learning model does not deteriorate. Here, you do not need to choose the best model, just prove that your algorithm works accurately.

Project Work Instructions:

- Load the data.
- Ensure that your data is free from issues â€” no missing values, outliers, etc.
- Complete each task and answer the questions provided in the final project task template.
- Draw conclusions based on your experience working on the tasks.
